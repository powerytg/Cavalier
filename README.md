Cavalier
========

High performance, moduler tablet + desktop friendly reference app (Flex 4.5/4.6)

Designed and built for demonstrating Adobe's multi-screen strategy, the Cavalier contains a set of UI components that put emphasis on mobile experience, but it also works perfectly fine on a desktop Flash environment.

While the Cavalier itself requires the server to run properly (not included), the Crescent UI itself is independent project and could be used without the rest of Cavalier modules.

Cavalier is the interface for the server, an admin console. The streaming media is served on Soprano and Hero, which are Android phone client and Android tablet client, respectfully. Please refer to their respect repo for the reference source code. 


History

The Cavalier project started on mid 2011, roughly 2 month before Adobe MAX 2011. The nature of the project is to build one single unified reference app that runs on both desktop and tablets (Android), with one single codebase and UI design. The purpose is to demo Adobe's Flash streaming technologies, enterprise level admin tools, Flash/Flex/Air and UI design, all in real world.


On MAX 2011

Cavalier is NOT to be shown in public booths, but rather in private to customers and fellow Flex developers in a 1-1 fashion.


The Cavalier modules

The Cavalier Project is organized by the following modules:

 * Cavalier Core
 * Cavalier Plugins
 * Cavalier SDK
 * Cavalier Browser Wrapper
 * Cresent UI




Author's Note

Cavalier is meant to be a reference on how to architecture large scale Flex based project. While Flex itself is gradually being out paced by HTML5 by now, know that the same design/architecture principle applies exactly on both javascript and actionscript world!
